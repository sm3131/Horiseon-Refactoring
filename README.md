# Code Refactor Starter Code
# <Horiseon-Refactoring>

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create a more accesible website for Horiseon's search engine optimization company. In order to achieve increased accessibility it was important to use the company's starter code and make improvements to both the HTML and CSS files. Making Horiseon's website more accesible required adding descriptions to the page's images, fixing broken links, and improving overall organization and navigation within the page. Along with improving accesibility it was also a goal to achieve proper semantic and logical structure of the HTML code as well as consolidate and simplify the CSS code. Improving the accesibility and refactoring the code for Horiseon's webpage solved two problems. The first is that the increased accesibility makes the site easier to use and navigate for people with disabilities. The second problem that was solved is that the HTML and CSS code for the page are now more concise and better organized making future work on Horiseon's website an easier task. 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

This project was created to make the existing Horsieon website more accesible as well as clean up the HTML and CSS code. So there are not necessarily installation steps, rather you will just need to open the website using the link provided in order to access Horiseon's new and more accisble website features.

## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
Since this project focused on refactoring code, the starter code files were already created by Xandromus. This project used Horiseon's working code with the goal of increasing its accesibility and improving its overall organization and function.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
