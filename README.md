# Horiseon Accessibility & Refactoring

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create a more accessible website for Horiseon's search engine optimization company. In order to achieve increased accessibility it was important to use the company's starter code and make improvements to both the HTML and CSS files. Making Horiseon's website more accessible required adding descriptions to the page's images, fixing broken links, and improving overall organization and navigation within the page. 

Along with improving accessibility, it was also a goal to achieve proper semantic and logical structure of the HTML code as well as consolidate and simplify the CSS code. Improving accessibility and refactoring the code for Horiseon's webpage solved two problems. The first is that the increased accessibility makes the site easier to use and navigate for people with disabilities. The second problem that was solved is that the HTML and CSS code for the page are now more concise and better organized making future work on Horiseon's website an easier task.

## Credits

Since this project focused on refactoring code, the starter code files were already created by Xandromus ([GitHub](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram)). This project used Horiseon's working code with the goal of increasing its accessibility and improving its overall organization and function.
